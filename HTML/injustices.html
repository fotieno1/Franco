   <h2>Injustice </h2> 
   <p>Settlers in Colonial America viewed the right to arms and/or the right to bear arms and/or state militias for these purposes  
    • enabling the people to organize a militia system
    • participating in law enforcement
    • safeguarding against tyrannical governments
    • repelling invasion
    • suppressing insurrection, allegedly including slave revolts though some scholars say the claim of a specific intent to protect the ability to put down slave revolts is not supported by the historical record
    • facilitating a natural right of self-defense

<h2>African Americans </h2>
<p>
African Americans have been mistreated for a long time. Let us not sweep the injustices by avoiding taking about racism. The privileged white people have for a long time benefited from these racist policies. They therefore oppose any discussion of critical race theory. Those who have suffered injustices from the police are advocating defunding. However let us ask ourselves what do we need policing for. An honest answer will reveal the strength of law enforcement in our society. We then have to increase funding for these services . The functions that don’t need the police should be funded elsewhere.
</p>
<h2> Qualified immunity </h2> <p>
The idea of qualified immunity in a constitution that garan equality for its citizens is inconsistent. We can not us 16th century laws to govern in the 21st. We have seen how cruel methods for controlling immigration. While those who espouse confederate ideology are praised by some as fine people who are loved their subversive activities are being ignored.</p>
