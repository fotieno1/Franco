 <h1> Individual</h1>  
 <p>Please help me make this website a repository for the truth for all races and people in the world. I don’t have $44 billion but the truth. The recent offer to buy twitter should be seen by the governing board as an attempt to spread hate speech on social media freely. The pretext is to claim that the social media is to be transformed for free speech. Recall how struggling news outlets have been bought and broken down. Thus effectively limiting flow of information to Americans. Learning them vulnerable to misinformation and conspiracy theories. Note the control of information that autocratic governments have used to control people and commit atrocities in their name.

  Stop risking our democracy. VOTE for high turnout can overcome gerrymander. The American people are being desensitized to the truth. They are being told what they can see is not the truth. Remember how the Supreme Court nominees lied to the senators to gain their votes while hiding their views on abortion. It is a criminal offense to lie to the FBI yet lies to the American people and senators is acceptable. The same lies led to the invasion of the capital and led to the election of the previous government. Most poor white people believed falsely that they were electing a government that would protect the forgotten. They elected a government that had no clue what is good for the United States of America. Help me develop this website as a counter to attempts to control information and spread propaganda and conspiracy theories. Those who invaded the capital planned their activities online and the buffalo shooter streamed his crime. Those of us who want to enjoy their second amendment right need to tell our leaders and communities how they will do so responsibly and shun those fomenting chaos while telling them they are protecting their right. Please help the government protect your community. Let us not wait for our leaders to solve the problems (guns, abortions, immigrations, climate change, the pandemic, public safety and elections ) Then this November let’s vote those who represent us and not the corporations that funded their campaign or the party. I am appealing to you to put United in USA. No one race can do it by themselves. It is wrong to label every white a racist just as it is to stereotype people of color. Was it not for a white man me as a black man from Africa would not have achieved the American dream, We can achieve a lot if we work together. Our children need to learn our history so they don’t repeat the same mistakes. Let us not cheat them by sugarcoating and whitewashing our history. There is currently an effort to stop critical race theory from being taught in our schools and therefore sugar coat the truth. Please trust and verify whatever your leaders are saying. There is a lot of misinformation out there and your vulnerability is assumed. Those who voted for the previous administration, is your life different because of your vote? Those who voted for the current administration are they doing what you asked. Remember that a drowning person will hold onto anything. This transition period when white rich people become the minority in less than twenty years is going to be the most dangerous. While some people have espoused the replacement theory. It has nothing to do with people of color, If anything it is related to the high cost of child care. Therefore many white people are foregoing having children. If not what prevents them from fulfilling their campaign promises? Let us give meaning to the words land of the brave and free. The pledge of allegiance says that we are one nation under God with liberty. Decide if your freedom is at the expense of others. There is a push to argue that it is your individual choice when it comes to the mandate. No one would fly in a plane with an untrained pilot, yet this is the position we are taking with our health. The injustice committed to the Tuskegee airmen have complicated the government’s efforts to protect the public. The truth is that you tow the party line which has been decided for you. Be wary of those using you to promote their views and don’t consider opposing positions and are ready to use violence to get their way. Be particularly worried about those intending to make the USA ungovernable using second amendment arguments ,trucks or gumming up government operations by legislation. The truth is that these people don’t care about you and are only using you to get their way. Once their goal is achieved you are alone and have not only destroyed your own government but have sabotaged your own sources of livelihood. Ask those who participated in invasion of the capital. Those who used trucks to block the Ambassador bridge in Canada did realize that their actions would affect the auto industry in the USA. As we remember Dr Martin Luther King, let us let our leaders show us whether their loyalty is for the people who elected them or the party. One former president lamented “ will my party listen to me” Now that our leaders have shown by their vote where they stand when it comes to voting in the coming election show your freedom by voting. Show who holds power in this country. Whether you are a judge in the supreme court forcing conservative views on liberals. A public defender convincing innocent people to plead guilty to a lesser charge for fear of racist jurors finding one guilty on a serious tramped allegation. Realtor dividing Americans by steering black people away from white neighborhood. Bankers denying black people economic opportunities based on their skin color. Employers profiling job seekers . Landlord denying black people housing based on their skin color or charging exorbitant rents encouraging them to leave. Guidance counselors misadvising students how easy it is to get into college and ignoring racism in admission. Individual calling the police on other Americans because of their skin color. In the words of the late John Lewis “ what did you do? “ The USA needs to realize that whatever happens in America is going to be aped around the world. Thus when Americans are showing racism and corruption it becomes difficult for the USA to preach morality to the world.
Make this country have a government for the people by the people. Let the people decide how they want to be governed.</p> 
 <h1>USA</h1> 
<p>I’m Appealing to the government of the United States of America to intervene so I can enjoy the constitutional guarantee of liberty and pursuit of happiness. I believe my inability to talk and limited mobility is not a reason for family to make decisions for me.All I need is someone without limited mobility so I can use the limited supplemental income and therefore exercise financial freedom instead of family members dictating me financially. The country also needs to go after the corrupt doctors and government officials the same way it handles corruption abroad, This will show leadership in fighting corruption. The country needs to realize that moderate conservatives fear of primary elections even when they can see the truth, Instead of arguing for reparations we should audit the wealth of people at present. The method has worked well in developing countries. Wealth that is tied to slavery money laundering false advertising and drugs poses a great risk to our democracy and are related to the problems that the country is experiencing.</p> 
<h1>International community </h1>  
<p>  Help me expose injustices and hypocrisy in your community because I believe that exposing them is a way to inform concerned authorities. The racial injustices currently seen in America will threaten the whole world. The role of the embassies has been reduced to government priorities. They do not intervene when their citizens are mistreated abroad. This is more so when a poor third world country citizen is mistreated in a super power country. This subservient international relation is hampering efforts to address global problems such as climate change . Globalization has made it easy for one person to influence the whole world particularly those well of economically and powerful with a strong military. The United Nations ought to take the threat of misinformation fueled by conspiracy theories and spread by digital means and cyber war to the global security. The danger of solving global challenges were recently demonstrated when the USA pulled out of the climate Change discussion and threatened to withdraw from WHO in the middle of a global pandemic.The United Nations have to come up with ways to fund global endeavors that don’t favor the rich and mighty.The events in Ukraine revealed that much of the world is not protected. Especially in Africa and South America . The events in Ukraine show what is in store for humanity under rich and militarily powerful autocratic governments. The invasion of the USA capital highlight how democracy is fragile. Each country had to consider its own interest before it could join the United States of America. The international community must therefore develop mechanisms for defense of democracy. Otherwise, the rich and militaries will continue to threaten global peace. The events have also demonstrated that the action of many countries is needed to solve global challenges such as climate change. Help remove the effects of toxic masculinity and racism in the world. It is partly responsible for both world wars and the current crisis in Ukraine. Eliminating Jews was part of the Nazi’s goal. More recently we have seen our leaders arguing about who had the best intercontinental ballistic missile. Ignoring the well established fact one of the leaders argued that they had the biggest. We know that viruses are smaller than bacteria yet they are the biggest threat to humans of the micro organisms.</p>
