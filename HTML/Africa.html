<h1>Africa</h1>
<p> The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean and Red seas to the north, Atlantic to the West, Indian to the east and Southern Oceans to the south. Early explorers used the monsoon trade winds for navigation. The long coastline and warm water according to satellite imagery derived from a NASA image makes the continent ideal for coastal infrastructure development. It doesnâ€™t experience the vagaries of extreme weather though droughts affect the continent according to the  IPCC. The population needs to be mobilized to address the effects of climate change. Its central location makes it ideal for global transportation. Studies have shown that investment in refugees created by endless conflicts in Africa have the potential for benefiting the continent as well as the refugees. Yet it remains one of the poverty stricken regions of the world. The mineral map by CIA shows that Africa  has many types of minerals and grains but because they do not invest in technology they have to rely on others to mine the reserves. Each country produces something that can be leverage through market aggregation. During the scramble among colonial powers, Africa was divided and it remains so currently. The experience with slavery and scramble by the colonial powers is unique to the continent and has shaped its development. Harnessing natural resources promises to make Africa independent provide energy, and employment for the local population. Africa remains an ideal location for international corporation due to the scramble and divisions it caused. The continent needs to take advantage of its size, position, water, rainfall, rainforest, population and its warm climate. Economic aid has been used by some Africans, political divisions by some donors to keep the continent poor and dependent on foreign aid. Looking at the continents that have dominated the world and you will notice that they have invested in research and economic integration.The equatorial rain forest holds secrets to medical  cures which are yet to be discovered. There are only two rainforests in the world and one is in Africa. There are people who are ready to go and participate in developing the continent but are held back because of the poverty and lack of services on the continent. Programs like the one proposed by UNESO in which African expatriates abroad are given funding if they want to return to the continent hold better prospects and need to be encouraged instead of economic aid. </p>
