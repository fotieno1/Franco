<h1>Experiences</h1>   
   <p> Francis Ochieng Otieno was born in Siaya-Kenya in 1967, to the late Mr. Raphael Otieno and Mrs. Alice Otieno. He attended Sirodha nursery before joining Central Primary School. He then joined Kisumu Boys Secondary School and the same High School. Legend has it that one of the former chiefs (Odera Akango) would make a family choose one child to go to school. The whole family was flogged if the child skipped school. Therefore, to avoid the caning, the whole family made sure that you attended school. This gives a different meaning to it takes a whole village to raise a child. No matter what you think of the policy, Sirodha is one of the places with the most educated people in Kenya. Sirodha is about ten miles from the birthplace of Obama senior. Though he never met the Obama’s he considers the former president of the USA an uncle. He moved to Zambezi a suburb of Nairobi and lived among Kikuyu and earned the name Otieno wa Njoroge. He attended the University of Nairobi where he earned a BSc and MSc in meteorology before joining Iowa State University where he earned another MS c and PhD. He then worked at the Byrd Polar Research Center at the Ohio State University and was living with his three children and wife. He was disabled in 2013 and spent five years in a nursing home. Over three years of these were spent unconscious. He naturalized to a citizen of the United States of America in 2018. His migration through the National Waiver Program makes him see his migration not as a favor as most refugees or beneficiaries of the diversity lottery program do. But a recognition for what he can do for the USA. A colleague nnce told him, I WILL NOT HOLD YOUR HANDS. My Professor had gone on sabbatical leave in a foreign country and would not be back in a year. He therefore found himself in a foreign country with no help. He therefore learned t survival techniques because he didn't want to fail the course. In hind sight this was the best advice he ever got. He thinks that this is what is lacking in the USA and our politics. If white people, black, immigrants,students,educators, law enforcement,employers and employees work together Americans can achieve a lot. He therefore laughs when our leaders call for immigrants that can rise by pulling their own bots.  <p>He went to the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center because of a spinning feeling whenever he turned his head. Following a misdiagnosis and a medical accident,  in which a medical student pumped food into his lungs. A  doctor at the hospital tried to kill him to hide the misdiagnosis and accident by tricking his wife to pull the plug on the life support equipment. She became suspicious because the computer was telling her a different thing. The doctor brought with himself other doctors including from Africa in an attempt to convince her to pull the plug. His employer used the same technique by bringing one of his friends to his bedside at the hospital. She then sought a second opinion from two independent doctors who warned her she was being cheated because of her ignorance of how ventilators work.d </p><div class="split" <img src="../Images/feeding.jpg" alt=""><img src="../Images/trac.jpg" alt=""></div><p>She then refused the doctor’s orders and this threw the murder plot into disarray. Apparently the doctor had sent a fax to the Ohio State University in advance. The Ohio Department of Health cannot produce a death certificate. The death was not reported to them. The Ohio State University consider him dead although he is alive and his supervisor was surprisingly quick to celebrate even announcing the death to a friend in Canada. At the nursing home he was put on excessive pain medication and fentanyl. This was an attempt to expedite the death and hide the evidence in a grave violating the Hippocratic oath and the Geneva convention on human rights. His wife insisted that the medications be discontinued. He regained consciousness after over three years and discovered that his medical records had been falsified to enable fraudulent billing of Medicaid.  </p> <p>His attempts to get the local, national and international media to tell the story failed. Watching a comedy in which a black father was encouraging his children to fight racial inequalities using their intelligence, he learned how to build a website. Demonstrations are easily hijacked and turned violent. The violence’s are then used to muddy the organizers message. Realizing that the Kenya government was not going to antagonize a super power and pursue corruption in another country, he learned to build a website by watching YouTube videos. This website was born. It allows him to tell his own story on the internet in a tightly controlled field. People only hear what the media wants them to hear. It is for this reason that you are learning of this injustice now though he has been trying to draw attention for four years. Being an immigrant, he has experienced firsthand the injustices faced by the community. For some even their presence is not acknowledged. One of the unintended consequences of laws making the working conditions unbearable for migrant workers is that it has taught them how to thrive in the harsh conditions, making them desirable for most jobs. A quality that has made them attractive for employers. It is an open secret that their contributions are critical in agriculture and advance research. More confused are children of immigrants who neither understand international law or the injustices and don’t fit in this society or that of the parents native countries. Even children of citizens don’t understand why they have to act one way in public and a different way in the privacy of their homes because of their skin color. To create a perfect union for humanity, he has made it his life mission to expose injustices and the facade clothed as law enforcement in the application of justice. Exposing both worldwide is one way to enable authorities to address both. He now resides in Columbus Ohio and cannot talk due to a medical procedure on his throat and interacts with the world exclusively by email. He speaks to his family via a text to speech synthesizer and uses a Bluetooth equipped computer. The read aloud function allows him to edit documents. He is trying to get a robotic arm to assist with limited mobility and uses an electronic wheelchair. He intends to provide consulting meteorological services. There are some details he will give to the department of Justice whenever the FBI gets to investigate the case. It will take legal scholars to address the statute of limitations that has been used to deny him justice and ties the hands of law firms.<p> <br><img src="../Images/t.png" alt="Timeline"><br> <p>It was impossible to have filed timely grievances because of unconsciousness and even now the disability prevents filing a complain because the courts are only designed for people with speech. Any attorney willing to help obtain justice is welcomed. Please note that the mistreatment corroborate accusations of the Chandler family against the nursing home. Having grown up in one of the poorest parts of Kenya (Nyalenda) no part of the USA is too  poor for him. He attended college with white students. He also attended international conferences with world renown scientists at venues  traditionally reserved for white people.  He therefore doesn’t fit the stereotype associated with African Americans and lacks the prejudice associated with white people.  He was therefore able to visit places in the USA considered no go for either. Surprisingly he found that some of the things our leaders said about the immigrants and in particular black people are simply untrue, yet the leaders claim they represent the people.
</p><h1> Death </h1>  
 <p>Many people would like me to describe what it is like to be dead. The thought of dying never even crossed my mind. What I know is that the things you could have done but didn’t are the ones that will haunt you the most. I hear my wife describing how I refused to let the doctor discuss my death with my children. Little did I know that my refusal was registering on the computer. So my wife asked me if I was ready to give up. I motioned no through my eyes. I don’t remember anything after that. In hindsight I now understand why one of the nurses was looking at me sympathetically. I think a decision to kill me by then had been made. The experience has led me to question the value of friends and family in ones life. What I know is that your abilities show when you are left alone. My discovery is that friends have no survival value for your existence. For parents do good for your children and don’t expect them to help you when you need them. The reality is that they will be exerting their freedom when you need them most
