<h3>Analysis</h3> 
<p>  My analysis diagnosed the United States of America, by examining its history. This will help you understand the recent events in the USA. There is a determined effort to dictate the world using religion, economic ,military might and continue  slavery. There is infiltration of the USA administration by white supremacists. The infiltration has affected the Congress and is now affecting the secret services.  It is noteworthy that those arrested for invading the capital came from counties that voted democratic. The failures to pass the infrastructure bill and actions on climate change suggests that the Democratic Party has also been infiltrated by republicans posing as democrats. It is a strategy of causing chaos and avoiding blame. Even the supreme courts have delegitimized itself and is now acting as an arm of the conservatives. The attorney to the former president warned of chaos should the former president lose and the former president clearly telegraphed his intentions. The conservative view keeps liberal ideas in check, but both are good for the country. Beliefs of the southern Baptist on abortion and gay rights are being used to govern USA. Left on its own the USA is on the way to a banana republic. While the population is naively supporting second amendment arguments the leaders need to understand that the population is being armed for an insurrection. Free speech arguments are used to promote hatred. Social media is being used to plan subversive activities. Things such as inflation and disruption of public services such as air travel and vaccines  have all been weaponized and are being used to force Americans to vote out administrations that don’t support racism.  By responding to this human induced inflation, the country may be forced into a recession. This will affect both conservative and liberal voters alike, not mentioning the corporations. The corporate mentality which does not respect workers is threatening the National economy. There has been a failure to start a race based civil war and now the population is being armed. The difference between the 2016 and 2020 elections is the turnout. The analysis shows how nearly equal percentages can be misinterpreted by most people. During the last elections the percentage was nearly equal but the turnout increased thus the same percentage as in 2016 results in higher numbers in 2020. The election has confirmed that there is no honor among thieves. Thus, the life of our former vice president was put in danger by the very administration he served loyally. Even Disney is discovering that the preferred status it has enjoyed can be eliminated. The recent reversal of Roe v Wade shows that the things immigrants have enjoyed in the USA are under threat. Interestingly the vote of immigrants gives them a louder voice on how the country is governed due to voter suppression efforts. Most of our leaders underestimate the effects of population increase on Americans. Housing meant for fewer people have to accommodate more people. The free market forces respond by causing rents to increase beyond the ability of most Americans. Similarly, Police departments that was planned for a few people now have to provide law enforcement for a larger population. The general and primary elections see decreased voting which has allowed a few leaders to masquerade as representatives of the people. Note that few people vote during the primaries and coupled with gerrymandering these people are accountable to nobody. Therefore, Americans will have to pay attention to who runs the county and state governments. The supreme court has left the issue to the people. It is therefore important to elect people who represent the majority view. Most of the country believes that abortion should be legal under some circumstances. Judicial activism is being used to cause chaos by upholding some laws and overturning precedents. The overturning of Roe v Wade is therefore perplexing and reveals the strategy of judicial activism, creating chaos in the USA . Whatever laws Congress passes and the Supreme Court uphold it is the American people who enforce it. Thus, state prosecutors in some states have given low priority to investigating abortion bans while some state attorney generals have quickly enforced the abortion bans. It is ironic that states that preferred the confederacy instead of the union are now the once concerned with unity. As flawed as the filibuster is, it is the only thing that has protected the minority view. But it has been abused by the minority of both parties to stop governments from enacting what is good for the country.

<h3>Caution </h3>  
 <p> Our leaders have to address the population increase or the problems will only get worse. The effects of climate Change are causing an existential threat to life on earth. California is seeing an increase in wild fire and increase in home insurance. At the individual level people are paying increased charges to cool their home. The low water levels at lake Mead threaten electricity production and businesses that depend on it for their water supply are being forced to stop. The federal government has been forced to ration the use of water. We can no longer bury our heads in the sand and refer to climate change as a hoax.   Beliefs of the southern Baptist on abortion and transgender are being used to amend our constitution in spite of the separation of government and religion. Those who believe in second amendment right are naively supporting an armed insurrection and chaos in the USA. Americans turn out in low numbers in primary elections and turnout in large numbers during elections to elect presidents. This is putting the presidents in a difficult position because they have to work with people who don’t support their views. It has allowed opinions of a few who have gerrymandered themselves into office to masquerade as representatives of the people. The recent overturning of Roe v Wade is an example of what Americans will experience if they don’t vote in general elections.</p>
