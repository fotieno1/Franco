<h1> Women journey </h1>
<p> 
The journey of women in the United States of America is reviewed to show the difficulties women faced, so present day women don’t take their rights for granted. They need to realize that some of the freedoms they enjoy are under threat. The cost of raising children is so high that women have had to leave the work force because they can not afford childcare. This is one of the reason for the shrinking white population. The census bureau estimates that white population will be a minority by 2060. It is therefore incumbent that they treat the minority communities fairly because they won’t be a majority of the voting population . It is difficult to fathom why women households earn less than their male counterparts doing the same jobs.
