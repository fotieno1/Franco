 <h2>Caution </h2>   
<p>  Our leaders have to address the population increase or the problems will only get worse. The inflation affecting Americans has been artificially enhanced to force them to vote out governments. The government is being paralyzed from inside. The abortion debate is a red herring to divide the women vote in the upcoming elections. The same technique is being used to divide the African Americans vote. Those who believe in slavery have a more difficult problem than Lincoln faced. There are now more African Americans and we have seen their capabilities. Not only are they educated but they have increased in number and hold influential positions in government. Strategies based on religion and fear are unlikely to work because we are seeing a decrease in Christianity. It is thus questionable whether southerners support those who enslaved them or are victims of the gerrymandering and southern strategy.The carefree attitude of handling of intelligence will make it harder for other countries to share intelligence with the USA. The world is seeing the struggles between the old leaders who want to keep things the way they have always been and younger inexperienced leaders who want to change things.  We must stop those using religion to divide us. It is a fact that we don’t understand everything, even doctors can not explain the placebo effect which is responsible for recovery without treatment. The attitudes and judicial tactics are familiar to any immigrants who have tried to achieve the American dream. Most criminal activity (NDA, Tax evasion and Plea deals ) involve attorneys. The whole world is seeing what migrants know about the USA. The effects of climate Change are causing an existential threat to life on earth. California is seeing an increase in wild fire and increase in home insurance. Glaciers are melting, coral bleaching is affecting the economy of countries that depend on tourism. Sea levels are rising threatening infrastructure particularly in coastal communities. At the individual level,  people are paying increased charges to cool their homes. The low water levels at lake Mead threaten electricity production and businesses that depend on it for their water supply are being forced to stop. The federal government has been forced to ration the use of water. We can no longer bury our heads in the sand and refer to climate change as a hoax.   Beliefs of the southern Baptist on abortion and transgender are being used to amend our constitution in spite of the separation of government and religion. Those who believe in second amendment right are naively supporting an armed insurrection and chaos in the USA. Our leaders have no clue how to eliminate the gun violence their policies have created. Those who are paralyzing the government of the USA need to be reminded that Disney enjoyed a preferred status until they questioned the authority. The former Vice President nearly paid with his life when those he was helping paralyze the government turned on him. Americans turn out in low numbers in primary elections and turnout in large numbers to elect presidents. This is putting the presidents in a difficult position because they have to work with people who don’t support their views. It has allowed opinions of a few who have gerrymandered themselves into office to masquerade as representatives of the people. The recent overturning of Roe v Wade is an example of what Americans will experience if they don’t vote in general elections.  We Americans need to realize that our laws don’t apply in other countries. The countries have their own constitutions and interests. The USA must not be seen as interested in deals that benefit themselves only, but are detrimental to the world. The USA must not be associated with unfairness  involving resources in other countries. The deals Americans are used to, are just advertisements for the excesses the corporations created. Thus whether you think you are getting a deal on airline tickets, hotels or cruises, you are only creating revenue for the corporations. The corporations will do everything to increase their bottom line and hold influence on political leaders so they can continue making massive profits, even if it hurts Americans , causing chaos for regimes or harming the environment. Be careful about freebies, preferred status and same as cash. They are being used in bait and switch schemes. Even scammers in Ponzi schemes, are using the same approach. The conservatives must explain how they plan to compensate for the revenue reduction caused by reducing taxes. Putting more money into your pockets is only a catchy campaign slogan. They have to distance themselves from the mentality that they are out to conserve racism and male dominance. Otherwise you are voting in an administration that will have less money for the increased population and services you are used to. My feeling is that you will see decreases in the services you are used to such as social security benefits and policing. Let Americans expose the controls of information on the internet to save our democracy. Autocratic governments have used it to spread propaganda and brain wash their population while committing crimes in their name. Abortion is a personal choice and the federal or state government has no business making the choice for Americans.  Nobody is forcing one to have an abortion. People can make the local government reflect their views. People will have to determine through their votes how to harmonize the patch of laws for the sake of the union. The supreme courts will then have to implement the laws and not force Americans to follow the views of the conservatives. The truth is that the government has no money but relies on your taxes. You are succeeding in starving the beast and helping our enemies. There is a price for benefiting from the union. Others have seen the benefits for USA and are rushing to annex other countries. But the USA has the advantage of knowing the dangers of annexation thus the Monroe principle. Those interested in annexing other countries need to pay attention. The USA has to decide whether they will use their immense wealth and military to promote peace around the world or face the fate of the British empire.  The USA risks forming a coalition of autocrats and the oppressed if they continue to be less than truthful. The world sees the hypocrisy.There are national security issues by outsourcing our manufacturing and training foreign students in our technologies. Discriminating children of immigrants poses a danger worse than domestic terrorism because they are citizens of the USA and not covered under the Foreign Surveillance Act. Immigrants coming to America be cautioned that America is a mixture of good and bad people and democracy is a work in progress. While the chips act gives money to American companies, Americans will have to accept the low wages the companies  have been paying by manufacturing abroad. This has subjected Americans to supply chain issues. Don’t forget that the reasons these companies outsourced manufacturing in the first place was to make more money by employment of cheaper labor. States have used taxpayer money to make guarantees to the companies but guarantees from the companies to the states are not clear. This amounts to blackmail of American people by bribing the companies that outsourced so that they can bring back American jobs.</p>
