<h1>Taxes </h1>
<p> Everyone wants more money in their pockets. But how do we achieve this goal for all Americans? The first thing we have to do is eliminate fraud in government services especially health care. The government will then tax for only services it absolutely needs to provide its citizens. Remember that if you are defrauding the government it has to tax more to provide the services you need, such as law health care, enforcement, fire and social insurance. Nobody goes into insurance to lose money. Thus whether you are defrauding auto insurance, home insurance insurance or life insurance you are raising the cost of the services. The business can stop providing the services or charge higher fees. The government is stuck with its citizens therefore you have to pay more in taxes if what they have is lost to fraud. The idea of cutting taxes amid a growing population is delusional. Unless you believe in taxation without representation and want someone to pay taxes for you.</p>
