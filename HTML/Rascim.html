 <h2>Racism in America </h2>   
    <p> I know that the current anger is directed at the Police because they happen to be brave enough to blatantly show the injustice openly. I want to draw your attention to other ways racism is shown subtly in the hope that exposing these injustices towards people of color will stimulate reforms.</li> 
    <ul>
    <li>I called the Columbus Police because someone had invaded my house , putting my life in danger. The Police agreed with invader that he was a resident of my house because he is my son and previously used my address.</li> 
    <li>I was given a mobile crisis response number which was not answered even after three days. This raises the question what the number is for,  when you can not use it in an emergency?</li> 
    <li> The composition of faculty in our institutions of higher learning clearly shows racism in employment. Students of color are  harshly graded. Children of color are mistreated in elementary, middle and high schools.  This makes them angry at the injustices and can lead to mass shootings. They are used to defraud the government in the provision of special needs and foster care.</li> 
    <li>Public defenders convince people of color to take plea deals because jurors are inclined to convict them because of their color , even if they have not committed any crimes.</li> 
    <li> There is an unequal treatment of people of color at medical facilities because they are unlikely to have medical insurance. The insurance provided by the government is also not accepted. Hence the afrdale care act is being sabotaged from inside</li> 
    <li>Following up of drivers of color the police to make them nervous so they can make enforceable mistakes.</li> 
    <li>Following people of color in grocery store in the guise of helping them because the associates believe they about to steal.</li> 
    <li>While I was a resident of a nursing home, I noticed the unfair treatment of people of color in work distributions and workloads in the work environment. It is my hope that exposing the injustices reform shed light into these areas in addition to Police activity.</li> 
     <li> The discrimination in housing, mental health and prisons disproportionately affect people of color.</li> 
    <li> The mistreatment of people of color who are also foreign nationals is having a detrimental image of America internationally.</li> 
    </ul>     </p>
