 <h3> Winds of change</h3>  
<p>There are many things that are changing the landscape in the USA. This has created instabilities as majorities ponder life as minorities.  The population is becoming more diverse amid decreasing white population. There are more educated African Americans and immigrants. There are more multiracial children resulting from interracial marriages. Thus, it is no longer possible to discriminate based on race. African Americans hold influential positions in the society. Therefore, the laws that were meant for black people are now being applied to white. The constitution requires the laws to apply equally to the races. Guns are no longer an option, they are owned by both  the white and black populations.</p>
