    <h1>Suggestions </h1>
    <p>
        I am suggesting that all ill gotten wealth be audited by the government. Because Some of the wealth have roots on of shoring to defraud the government of USA which forces the few individuals to pay higher taxes to balance the budget. Some of the money has grown up from proceeds of racketeering ,unfair practices in distribution of development and national resources, human trafficking, slavery and efforts to continue it, money laundering, tax evasion, unfair college admission, peddling hate and misinformation. The misinformation is the basis of conspiracy theories and is used for purposes of raising money. Misinformation should be taxed differently from verifiable facts. Holding people and corporations accountable for misinformation and misleading advertisements for financial gain. Media should be stopped from allowing their platforms to be used to spread misinformation. One has to explain if they want to send money abroad, yet people are planning subversive activities online and buying weapons used in mass shooting using credit cards. Holding the gun lobby to higher standards because their support has the potential to cause chaos in the USA. Reducing disparities in services, causing things like food deserts. The corporations have basically shot them selves in the foot by investing in white neighborhoods only, which are seeing decreased  population. Companies like Walmart which depend on healthy large population see their revenue increasing with population. Marginalization of large segments of the population is partly responsible for the rise in crime. Where do the marginalized community go for sustenance? The corporations have to pay more to buy insurance for their business. Although it appears counter intuitive, corporations can enhance profits and safety by investments in the marginalized communities. As Americans we have to change how we look at and get money. It should not be at the expense of the environment our children will inherit. Climate Change is threatening not only our national security but life on earth. It is this view that makes corporations not respect their employees and corrupts our politics and international policies. Corporation should and politicians need to shun advertisements that spread fear and promote racism and conspiracy theories. Some things have no prices for harm to society such as marketing guns and drugs. Our leaders need to find ways to free Americans from debt that has been created by corporations through mortgage and student loans. They  prevent  people from telling our leaders the truth and allows corporations to maintain a strong influence on the people. Our leaders need to break the strong hold on information because it is responsible for the loss in touch between people and their representatives. This allows our politicians to enact their own views and our leaders to govern blindly. We need to use our taxes for equitable growth. The wowing of corporations that shipped American jobs abroad is unfair. The goal of bringing manufacturing back is bribing them to invest in white communities using taxpayer money. Thus, is promoting racism. We need to reduce our dependence on oil import not only does it force us to cozy to autocratic governments but subjects us to supply chain vulnerabilities. The USA must lead the world in fairness and avoid national interest based on religion. It should not engage in subversive activities. It must not stoop so low as to permit torture and cruelty to immigrants. We the people of America should consider impeachment of our leaders and members of the Supreme Court and judges practicing judicial activism from the bench. Term limits should apply for supreme courts appointments. We know that dementia sets in with age. The presidents who appoint them have term limits so are members of the legislature. We the people need to think about do it yourself governance. Americans have to vote on all elections to protect our democracy. We must all unite ,white, black , male or female, rich or poor religious affiliations, employers or employees and immigrants. Let our unity transcend our political parties, democratic or republican. Instead of defunding the police hold them accountable. The attacks on law enforcement are a recipe for anarchy. The corporations and individuals supporting it will not gain from investments as they are used to in lawless communities. Let us stop defending espionage and treason against our country as we watch our own Hitler. The entire world needs to fight the misinformation and propaganda that has been used to brain wash large groups of the populations. Atrocities can then be committed in their names because they have been reduced to robots. Keeping them from thinking because they are religious believers unable to question anything.
