<p>Before examining the history of the USA we will examine the history of the states that have dominated politics in the USA 
<p><h3>Florida </h3>

<p>Various Native American groups have inhabited Florida for at least 14,000 years. In 1513, Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de León became the first known European to make landfall, calling the region La Florida for its lush greenery and the Easter season. The earliest known European explorers came with the Spanish conquistador Juan Ponce de León. Ponce de León spotted and landed on the peninsula on April 2, 1513. Florida subsequently became the first area in the continental U.S. to be permanently settled by Europeans, with the Spanish colony of St. Augustine, founded in 1565, being the oldest continuously inhabited city. Florida was repeatedly contested by Spain and Great Britain, before being ceded to the U.S. in 1819; it was admitted as the 27th state on March 3, 1845. Florida was the principal location of the Seminole Wars (1816–1858), the longest and most extensive of the Indian Wars in U.S. history. The state seceded from the Union on January 10, 1861, becoming one of the seven original Confederate States. After the Civil War, Florida was the first region of the continental United States to be visited and settled by Europeans. The state's close proximity to the ocean has shaped its culture, identity, and daily life. By the 16th century, the earliest time for which there is a historical record, major groups of people living in Florida included the Apalachee of the Florida Panhandle, the Timucua of northern and central Florida, the Ais of the central Atlantic coast, and the Calusa of southwest Florida. Colonial history and successive waves of migration are reflected in African, European, Indigenous, Latino, and Asian influences. In 1559, Don Tristán de Luna y Arellano established a settlement at present-day Pensacola, making it the first attempted settlement in Florida, but it was mostly abandoned by 1561. In 1565, the settlement of St. Augustine was established under the leadership of admiral and governor Pedro Menéndez de Avilés, creating what would become one of the oldest, continuously occupied European settlement. Spanish married or had unions with Pensacola, Creek or African women, both slave and free, and their descendants created a mixed-race population of mestizos and mulattos. The Spanish encouraged slaves from the Thirteen Colonies to come to Florida as a refuge, promising freedom in exchange for conversion to Catholicism. King Charles II of Spain issued a royal proclamation freeing all slaves who fled to Spanish Florida and accepted conversion and baptism. Augustine had mustered an all-black militia unit defending Spanish Florida as early as 1683. In 1763, Spain traded Florida to the Kingdom of Great Britain for control of Havana, Cuba, which had been captured by the British during the Seven Years' War. The trade was done as part of the 1763 Treaty of Paris. The British government gave land grants to officers and soldiers who had fought in the French and Indian War in order to encourage settlement.h ended the Seven Years' War. Spain was granted Louisiana from France due to their loss of Florida. The British governors were directed to call general assemblies as soon as possible in order to make laws for the Floridas, and in the meantime they were, with the advice of councils, to establish courts. This was the first introduction of the English-derived legal system which Florida still has today, ncluding trial by jury, habeas corpus and county-based government.Neither East Florida nor West Florida sent any representatives to Philadelphia to draft the Declaration of Independence. Florida remained a Loyalist stronghold for the duration of the American Revolution.

Spain regained both East and West Florida after Britain's defeat in the Revolutionary War and the subsequent Treaty of Versailles in 1783, and continued the provincial divisions until 1821. Florida had become a burden to Spain, which could not afford to send settlers or troops due to the devastation caused by the Peninsular War. Madrid, therefore, decided to cede the territory to the United States through the Adams–Onís Treaty,American settlers began to establish cotton plantations in north Florida, which required numerous laborers, which they supplied by buying slaves in the domestic market. On January 10, 1861, nearly all delegates in the Florida Legislature approved an ordinance of secession, declaring Florida to be "a sovereign and independent nation"—an apparent reassertion to the preamble in Florida's Constitution of 1838, in which Florida agreed with Congress to be a "Free and Independent State." The ordinance declared Florida's secession from the Union, allowing it to become one of the founding members of the Confederate States. After the Reconstruction period ended in 1876, white Democrats regained power in the state legislature. In 1885, they created a new constitution, followed by statutes through 1889 that disfranchised most blacks and many poor whites. Forty thousand blacks, roughly one-fifth of their 1900 population levels, left the state in the Great Migration. They left due to lynchings and racial violence, and for better opportunities in the North and the West. Disfranchisement for most African Americans in the state persisted until the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s gained federal legislation in 1965 to enforce protection of their constitutional suffrage. In response to racial segregation in Florida, a number of protests occurred in Florida during the 1950s and 1960s as part of the Civil Rights Movement.

</p><h3>New York</h3> 
<p>The first documented visit into New York Harbor by a European was in 1524 by Italian Giovanni da Verrazzano, an explorer. A Spanishexpedition, led by the Portuguese captain Estêvão Gomes, sailing for  Emperor Charles V, arrived in New York Harbor in January 1525. English explorer Henry Hudson rediscovered New York Harbor while searching for the Northwest Passage to the Orient for the Dutch East India Company. He proceeded to sail up what the Dutch would name the North River (now the Hudson River), named first by Hudson as the Mauritius after Maurice, Prince of Orange.New York City traces its origins to a trading post founded on the southern tip of Manhattan Island by Dutch colonists in approximately 1624.  New Amsterdam, centered in the eventual Lower Manhattan, in 1664, the year England took control and renamed it "New York". After the founding, the duke gave part of the colony to proprietors George Carteret and John Berkeley. Fort Orange, 150 miles (240 km) north on the Hudson River, was renamed Albany after James's Scottish title. A permanent European presence near New York Harbor began in 1624. In 1664, unable to summon any significant resistance, Stuyvesant surrendered New Amsterdam to English troops. In 1664, the city was named in honor of the Duke of York, who would become King James II of England. James's elder brother, King Charles II, appointed the Duke proprietor of the former territory of New Netherland, including the city of New Amsterdam, when England seized it from the Dutch. In the precolonial era, the area of present-day New York City was inhabited by Algonquian Native Americans, including the Lenape. Following the purchase, New Amsterdam grew slowly. To attract settlers, the Dutch instituted the patroon system in 1628, whereby wealthy Dutchmen (patroons, or patrons) who brought 50 colonists to New Netherland would be awarded swaths of land, along with local political autonomy and rights to participate in the lucrative fur trade.  Several intertribal wars among the Native Americans and some epidemics brought on by contact with the Europeans caused sizable population losses for the Lenape. It also became a center of slavery, with 42% of households holding slaves by 1730, the highest percentage outside Charleston, South Carolina. Slavery became integrally tied to New York's economy through the labor of slaves throughout the port, and the banking and shipping industries trading with the American South. Discovery of the African Burying Ground in the 1990s, during construction of a new federal courthouse near Foley Square, revealed that tens of thousands of Africans had been buried in the area in the colonial period.. The draft riots deteriorated into attacks on New York's elite, followed by attacks on Black New Yorkers and their property after fierce competition for a decade between Irish immigrants and Black people for work. Rioters burned the Colored Orphan Asylum to the ground, with more than 200 children escaping harm due to efforts of the New York Police Department, which was mainly made up of Irish immigrants. 
 
 







</p><h3>Ohio</h3> 
<p>Archeological evidence of spear points of both the Folsom and Clovis types indicate that the Ohio Valley was inhabited by nomadic people as early as 13,000 BC. These early nomads disappeared from Ohio by 1,000 BC. Between 1,000 and 800 BC, the sedentary Adena culture emerged. The most notable remnant of the Adena culture is the Great Serpent Mound. Beginning in 1754, the Kingdom of France and Kingdom of Great Britain fought in the French and Indian War. As a result of the Treaty of Paris, the French ceded control of Ohio and the remainder of the Old Northwest to Great Britain in 1763.  In the Treaty of Paris in 1783, The coalition of Native American tribes, known as the Western Confederacy, was forced to cede extensive territory, including much of present-day Ohio, in the Treaty of Greenville in 1795. In 1776, Putnam created a method of building portable fortifications, which enabled the Continental Army to drive the British. By 1842, all remaining Natives were forced out of the state. Britain ceded all claims to Ohio Country to the new United States after its victory in the American Revolutionary War. Ohio country was also the site of Indian massacres, such as the Yellow Creek Massacre, Gnadenhutten and Pontiac's Rebellion school massacre. After the War of 1812 when Natives suffered serious losses such as at Tippecanoe, most Native tribes either left Ohio or had to live on only limited reservations. By the end of the Civil War, the Union had three generals. Slavery was not permitted in the new territory. Settlement began with the founding of Marietta by the Ohio Company of Associates, which had been formed by a group of American Revolutionary War veterans.  In 1802, Putnam served in the convention to form a constitution for the State of Ohio. 





<h3>Kentucky</h3> 
<p>In 1776 the counties of Virginia beyond the Appalachian Mountains became known to European Americans as Kentucky County, named for the Kentucky River. Others have suggested the term Kenta Aki, which could have come from an Algonquian language and were possibly derived from Shawnee. French explorers in the 17th century documented numerous tribes living in Kentucky until the Beaver Wars in the 1670s; however, by the time that European colonial explorers and settlers began entering Kentucky in greater numbers in the mid-18th century, there were no major Native American settlements in the region. As of the 16th century, the area known as Kentucky was home to tribes from five different culture groups – Iroquoian, Sioux, Algonquian, Muskogean and Yuchi. In 1774 James Harrod founded the first permanent European settlement in Kentucky at the site of present-day Harrodsburg. On several occasions the region's residents petitioned the General Assembly and the Confederation Congress for separation from Virginia and statehood. Congress thought that it would be "unadvisable" to admit Kentucky into the Union, as it could do so "under the Articles of Confederation" only, but not "under the Constitution", and so declined to take action. Kentucky officially became the fifteenth state in the Union on June 1, 1792. A 1790 U.S. government report states that 1,500 Kentucky settlers had been killed by Native Americans since the end of the Revolutionary War.[26] As more settlers entered the area, warfare broke out with the Native Americans over their traditional hunting grounds. Central Kentucky, the bluegrass region, was the area of the state with the most slave owners. Planters cultivated tobacco and hemp (see Hemp in Kentucky) and were noted for their quality livestock. During the 19th century, Kentucky slaveholders began to sell unneeded slaves to the Deep South, with Louisville becoming a major slave market and departure port for slaves being transported downriver. Kentucky was one of the border states during the American Civil War, and it remained part of the Union. Despite this, representatives from 68 of 110 counties met at Russellville calling themselves the "Convention of the People of Kentucky" and passed an Ordinance of Secession on November 20, 1861.[30] They established a Confederate government of Kentucky with its capital in Bowling Green. Although Confederate forces briefly controlled Frankfort, they were expelled by Union forces before a Confederate government could be installed in the state capital. After the expulsion of Confederate forces after the Battle of Perrysville, this government operated in-exile. Though it existed throughout the war, Kentucky's provisional government had very little effect on the events in the Commonwealth or in the war Kentucky remained officially "neutral" throughout the war due to the Union sympathies of a majority of the Commonwealth's citizens. Despite this, some 21st-century Kentuckians observe Confederate Memorial. Day on Confederate leader Jefferson Davis' birthday, June 3, and participate in Confederate battle re-enactments. The Black Patch Tobacco Wars, a vigilante action, occurred in Western Kentucky in the early 20th century. As a result of the tobacco industry monopoly, tobacco farmers in the area were forced to sell their crops at prices that were too low. Many local farmers and activists united in a refusal to sell their crops to the major tobacco companies.


</p><h3>Iowa</h3>   
<p>During the 18th and early 19th centuries, Iowa was a part of French Louisiana and Spanish Louisiana; its state flag is patterned after the flag of France. After the Louisiana Purchase, people laid the foundation for an agriculture-based economy in the heart of the Corn Belt. In the latter half of the 20th century, Iowa's agricultural economy transitioned to a diversified economy of advanced manufacturing, processing, financial services, information technology, biotechnology, and green energy production.When American Indians first arrived in what is now Iowa more than 13,000 years ago, they were hunters and gatherers living in a Pleistocene glacial landscape.The first known European explorers to document Iowa were Jacques Marquette and Louis Jolliet who traveled the Mississippi River in 1673 documenting several Indigenous villages on the Iowa side.Fort Madison was built to control trade and establish U.S. dominance over the Upper Mississippi, but it was poorly designed and disliked by the Sauk and Fox, many of whom allied with the British, who had not abandoned claims to the territory. The first American settlers officially moved to Iowa in June 1833. Primarily, they were families from Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, Indiana, Kentucky, and Virginia who settled along the western banks of the Mississippi River, founding the modern day cities of Dubuque and Bellevue. On July 4, 1838, the U.S. Congress established the Territory of Iowa. Iowa supported the Union during the Civil War, voting heavily for Abraham Lincoln, though there was an antiwar "Copperhead" movement in the state.The Great Depression and World War II accelerated the shift away from smallholder farming to larger farms, and began a trend of urbanization. In 1975, Governor Robert D. Ray petitioned President Ford to allow Iowa to accept and resettle Tai Dam refugees fleeing the Indochina War

</p><h3> West Virginia </h3> 
<p>King Charles II of England, in 1661, granted to a company of gentlemen the land between the Potomac and Rappahannock rivers, known as the Northern Neck. Few Native Americans lived permanently within the state's present limits, but the region was a common hunting ground, crossed by many trails. The rugged terrain made slavery unprofitable. In 1829, a constitutional convention met in Richmond to consider reforms to Virginia's outdated constitution. Philip Doddridge of Brooke County championed the cause of western Virginians who sought a more democratic frame of government but western reforms were rejected by leaders from east of the Alleghenies who "clung to political power in an effort to preserve their plantation lifestyles dependent on enslaving blacks". Virginia leaders maintained a property qualification for suffrage, effectively disenfranchising poorer farmers in the west whose families did much of the farm work themselves. West Virginia was the only state in the Union to separate from a Confederate state (Virginia) during the Civil War. Thus there were two state governments in Virginia: one pledging allegiance to the United States and one to the Confederacy. On May 13, 1862, the state legislature of the reorganized government approved the formation of the new state. On December 31, 1862, President Abraham Lincoln approved an enabling act admitting West Virginia on the condition that a provision for the gradual abolition of slavery be inserted in its constitution . The area that became West Virginia actually furnished about an equal number of soldiers to the Union and Confederate armies.




</p><h3>South Carolina</h3> 
<p>The Spanish were the first Europeans in the area. On October 8, 1526, they founded San Miguel de Gualdape1540, Hernando de Soto explored the region and the main town of  Cofitachequi, where he captured the queen of the Maskoki (Muscogee) and  Chelaque (Cherokee) who had welcomed him. In 1562 French Huguenots established a settlement. 1629, In,: 109  was the largest among the British colonies in North America. As dissatisfaction of the planters ruling class with the federal government grew, in the 1820s John C. Calhoun became a leading proponent of states' rights, limited government, nullification of the U.S. Constitution, and free trade. Lincoln was elected president on November 6, 1860. The state House of Representatives three days later passed the "Resolution to Call the Election of Abraham Lincoln as U.S. President a Hostile Act", and within weeks South Carolina became the first state to secede. In the late 19th century, South Carolina would implement Jim Crow laws which enforced racial segregation policies until the 1960s. As of 2015, South Carolina had one of the lowest percentages among all states of women in state legislature, at 13.5% (only Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Wyoming had a lower percentage; the national average is 24.3%; with the highest percentage being in Colorado at 41%). In 2011, South Carolina ranked first in the country in the rate of women killed by men. 



 









<h3>Mississippi</h3> 
<p>Near 10,000 BC Native Americans or Paleo-Indiansarrived in what today is referred to as the American South. Descendant Native American tribes of the Mississippian culture in the Southeast include the Chickasaw and Choctaw. The first major European expedition into the territory that became Mississippi was that of the Spanish explorer, Hernando de Soto. In April 1699, French colonists established the first European settlement at Fort Maurepas (also known as Old Biloxi). Under French and Spanish rule, there developed a class of free people of color (gens de couleur libres), mostly multiracial descendants of European men and enslaved or free black women, and their mixed-race children. The British assumed control of the French territory after the French and Indian War. During the colonial era, European settlers imported enslaved Africansto work on cash crop plantations. In 1819 the United States completed the purchase of West Florida and all of East Florida in the Adams–Onís Treaty. After the American Revolution (1775–83), Britain ceded this area to the new United States of America. From 1800 to about 1830, the United States purchased some lands (Treaty of Doak's Stand) from Native American tribes for new settlements of European Americans. New settlers kept encroaching on Choctaw land, and they pressed the federal government to expel the Native Americans. Article 14 in the treaty allowed those Choctaw who chose to remain in the states to become U.S. citizens, as they were considered to be giving up their tribal membership. Many slaveholders brought enslaved African Americans with them or purchased them through the domestic slave trade, especially in New Orleans. Beginning in 1822, slaves in Mississippi were protected by law from cruel and unusual punishment by their owners. President Andrew Jackson's Indian Removal Act and the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek[28] of 1830, the Choctaw were effectively forced to sell their land and were transported to Oklahoma Territory.  When cotton was king during the 1850s, Mississippi plantation owners—especially those of the Delta and Black Belt central regions—became wealthy due to the high fertility of the soil, the high price of cotton on the international market, and free labor gained through their holding enslaved African Americans.  it was one of the founding members of the Confederate States. During the war, Union and Confederate forces struggled for dominance on the Mississippi River, critical to supply routes and commerce. Mississippians fought in the Civil War for the Confederate Army. In the postwar period, freedmen withdrew from white-run churches to set up independent congregations.  Democratic whites were well armed and formed paramilitary organizations such as the Red Shirts to suppress black voting. However, black residents were deprived of all political power after white legislators passed a new state constitution in 1890 specifically to "eliminate the nigger from politics. It erected barriers to voter registration and instituted electoral provisions that effectively disenfranchised most black Mississippians and many poor whites. The loss of political influence contributed to the difficulties of African Americans in their attempts to obtain extended credit in the late 19th century. Together with imposition of Jim Crow and racial segregation laws, whites increased violence against blacks, lynching mostly men, through the period of the 1890s and extending to 1930.  In 1923, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People stated "the Negro feels that life is not safe in Mississippi and his life may be taken with impunity at any time upon the slightest pretext or provocation by a white man". So many African Americans left in the Great Migration that after the 1930s, they became a minority in Mississippi.  White Citizens Councils had been formed in many cities and towns to resist integration of schools following the unanimous 1954 United States Supreme Courtruling (Brown v. Board of Education) that segregation of public schools was unconstitutional. Chapters of the Ku Klux Klan and its sympathizers used violence against activists. After decades of disenfranchisement, African Americans in the state gradually began to exercise their right to vote again for the first time since the 19th century, following the passage of federal civil rights legislation in 1964 and 1965, which ended de jure segregation and enforced constitutional voting rights. In 1987, 20 years after the U.S. Supreme Court had ruled in 1967's Loving v. Virginia that a similar Virginian law was unconstitutional, Mississippi repealed its ban on interracial marriage (also known as miscegenation), which had been enacted in 1890.  The previous flag of Mississippi, used until June 30, 2020, featured the Confederate battle flag. 

</p><h3>California</h3> 
<p>Prior to European colonization, California was one of the most culturally and linguistically diverse areas in pre-Columbian North America. European exploration in the 16th and 17th centuries led to the colonization of California by the Spanish Empire. In 1804, it was included in Alta Californiaprovince within the Viceroyalty of New Spain.  During this same period, sailors from the Russian Empire explored along the California coast and in 1812 established a trading post. The area became a part of Mexico in 1821, following its successful war for independence, but was ceded to the United States in 1848 after the Mexican–American War. The western portion of Alta California was then organized and admitted as the 31st state on September 9, 1850, following the Compromise of 1850. The California Gold Rush started in 1848 and led to dramatic social and demographic changes, including large-scale immigration into California, a worldwide economic boom, and the California genocide of indigenous people. The Spaniards gave the name Las Californias to the peninsula of Baja California and to Alta California, the region that became the present-day state of California. Queen Calafia's kingdom was said to be a remote land rich in gold and pearls. In 1821, the Mexican War of Independence gave the Mexican Empire(which included California) independence from SpainThe Spanish missions in California (Spanish: Misiones españolas en California) comprise a series of 21 religious outposts or missions established between 1769 and 1833 in what is now the U.S. state of California. The missions, which controlled most of the best land in the state, were secularized by 1834 and became the property of the Mexican government.[52] The governor granted many square leagues of land to others with political influence. John Marsh. After failing to obtain justice against squatters on his land from the Mexican courts, he determined that California should become part of the United States. He invited immigrants to stay on his ranch until they could get settled, and assisted in their obtaining passports.[58] In 1846, a group of American settlers in and around Sonomarebelled against Mexican rule during the Bear Flag Revolt. hen Commodore John D. Sloat of the United States Navy sailed into Monterey Bay and began the military occupation of California by the United States. Following the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (February 2, 1848) that ended the war, the westernmost portion of the annexed Mexican territory of Alta California soon became the American state of California, and the remainder of the old territory was then subdivided into the new American Territories of Arizona, Nevada, Colorado and Utah. In 1848, only one week before the official American annexation of the area, gold was discovered in California, this being an event which was to forever alter both the state's demographics and its finances.  The population burgeoned with United States citizens, Europeans, Chinese and other immigrants during the great California Gold Rush

















<p>   To understand the United States of America, one has to look at its history. It is believed that the natives came through the ice free corridors on the north west. The British then colonized the east. At the time Europeans arrived, marking the end of the Pre-Columbian era around 1600, there were many separate Native American tribes, the largest being the Cherokee and the Catawba. Lacking immunity from the diseases in Europe many of the natives  died from diseases brought by the colonialists. Later more land was acquired by the colonialists through war, treaties and purchases. Slaves were brought to provide labor. They have therefore always been mistreated as if they don’t belong. There is a push to white wash our history by removal of monuments and not teaching critical race theory. They say those that don’t learn from history are bound to repeat it. Nobody wants the  bad things in our history to be repeated. The colonialists landed at Jamestown Virginia on May 24th under the patent of the London company. The Dutch then built a trading post on Manhattan for trading fur with the Indians. In 1619 ,20 blacks landed at Jamestown to be sold. The Mayflower anchored and the colonialists disembark. Settlements were then established in New Hampshire and Maine. The settlers destroyed the Indian village ending the Pequot war. Swedes. King Charles wishes that communication be established between the colonies. He grants large tract of land to William Penn and he names it Pennsylvania. He then invites Germans who  start a huge German immigration and the founding of German town. South Carolina was named in honor of King Charles I of England,one of the Thirteen Colonies, South Carolina became a royal colony in 1719. A slave state, it was the first state to vote in favor of secession from the Union on December 20, 1860. King of England Charles I established the Province of Carolina, an area covering what is now South and North Carolina, Georgia and Tennessee.  1663, Charles II granted the land to eight Lords Proprietors in return for their financial and political assistance in restoring him to the throne in 1660The Carolina slave trade, which included both trading and direct raids by colonists. Plantation labor was done by African slaves who formed the majority of the population by 1720n 1712, the former Province of Carolina split in to North and South Carolina. Rice cultivation was developed on a large scale on the back of slave labor. While nominally democratic, from 1790 until 1865, wealthy landowners were in control of South Carolina.  I Southern secessionists believed Lincoln's election meant long-term doom for their slavery-based agrarian economy and social system.The civil rights movement of the mid-20th century helped in ending segregation and legal discrimination policies within the state .The French construct fort Machinac to secure their hold on the Mississippi River Valley to protect the route from Canada to the Louisiana territory. Another fort was constructed in Detroit. Carolina colonialists burn Spanish settlement while a Swiss settlement is destroyed by Indians. Germans settlers open the regions across the Aleghany. New Orleans is settled by immigrants from Canada and France. Colonialists from Northern Ireland and Scotland settle in New Hampshire. Then French colony exiles all Jewish settlers and enacted code to regulate activities of blacks. Carolina settlers use the Anglo-Spanish war as an excuse to attack Spanish settlements. Famine in Ireland leads to migration to the Shenandoah and the colonies of Virginia, Georgia and the Carolinas. The English Privy Council then grants 200,000 acres of land in the territory between the Ohio and the Great Kanawha Rivers and the Allegheney Mountains to the Ohio Company; The Ohio Company also receives a royal charter from King George II for an additional grant of 500,000 acres along the upper Ohio River. The Colony of Virginia grants 800,000 acres west of the Virginia-North Carolina border to the Loyal Company. Having settled in Connecticut and Massachusetts the settlers turned north. The unavailability of good land forces the expansion to veer to Pennsylvania and the southern colonies. A group of Germans buy 100000 acres north of Carolina. The Grand Ohio Company is organized by Englishmen to procure a grant of 20 million acres from the English crown under provisions of theTreaty of Stanwix. North Carolina Judge Richard Henderson and some of his friends found the  Transylvania Company for the purposes of land speculation in the Kentucky region. The population of the 13 colonies is estimated at about 1,600,000. The  Illinois and Wabash Land Companies are organized to purchase large tracts of western territory. Pennsylvanian James Harrod establishes Harrodsburg, the first permanent settlement in the Kentucky Territory. On California’s coast, Spanish missionaries establish San Franciso de Asis, a settlement known popularly as Yerba Buena. In 1849, it becomes the city of San Francisco. In January, settlers of the New Hampshire  declare their independence and establish a “republic” with the name of New Connecticut. This is the area which was formerly the part of New Hampshire Colony west of the Connecticut River, now claimed by New York. In July, New Connecticut renames itself Vermont. Territory won from the British post at Kaskaskia by George Rogers Clark is annexed by Virginia, as the County of Illinois. Congress issues a resolution encouraging states to cede South Carolina political figures, like Sen. Strom Thurmond, on the other hand, were among the nation's most radical and effective opponents of social equality their western territories to the Union to be settled and admitted to the Union as states in their own right. Spanish Franciscan Fathers in southern California found a mission village, El Pueblo Nuestra Senora la Reina de los Angeles de Porciuncula—it becomes Los Angeles. On November 30, American and British representatives sign a preliminary peace treaty. The British recognize American independence, specifying boundaries for the United States, continued American fishing rights off the coast of eastern Canada, validation of debts, the restoration of rights and property to American Loyalists, and withdrawal of British forces from America’s territory. On September 3, in Paris, the Treaty of Paris is signed by Great Britain and the United States, ending the American Revolutionary war. The union of the thirteen original colonies was then formed, others joined to form what is currently known as the USA. The expansion means the USA is a melting pot of people that originated from different places. This is seen in the racial index. The more diverse the population is, the more democratic  it tends to be. Thus, the notion that some view this country as theirs is false. Through conquest and migration, the country has developed in a way that would have been impossible. It was thus important that the colonies and later citizens of the new states have a way to protect themselves. The Settlers in Colonial America felt unsafe and viewed the right to arms and/or the right to bear arms and/or state militias as important for one or more of these purposes </p> 
 
<h1>Juneteenth</h1>
<p> Juneteenth is a federal holiday in the United States commemorating the emancipation of enslaved African Americans. Formerly enslaved people in Galveston rejoiced after the announcement. President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863, freeing the enslaved people in Texas and all the rebellious parts of Southern secessionist states of the Confederacy.  Despite the surrender of Confederate General-in-Chief Robert E. Lee at Appomattoax Court House on April 9, 1865, the western Confederate Army of the Trans-Mississippi did not surrender until June 2. Enforcement of the Proclamation generally relied upon the advance of Union troops. Texas, as the most remote state of the former Confederacy,  had a low presence of Union troops as the American Civil War ended. Although the Emancipation Proclamation declared an end to slavery in the Confederate States, it did not end slavery in states that remained in the Union. Those enslaved people were freed with the ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution, which abolished chattel slavery nationwide on December 6, 1865. The last enslaved people present in the continental United States were freed when those held by the Choctaw, who had sided with the Confederacy, were released in 1866.  The Black community began using the word Juneteenth for Jubilee Day early in the 1890s.
The day was first celebrated in Austin in 1867 under the auspices of the Freedmen's Bureau, and it had been listed on a "calendar of public events" by 1872. That year, black leaders in Texas raised $1,000 for the purchase of 10 acres (4 ha) of land, today known as Houston's Emancipation Park, to celebrate Juneteenth marks the anniversary of the announcement of General Order No. 3 by Union Army general Gordon Granger on June 19, 1865, proclaiming freedom for enslaved people in Texas. Originating in Galveston, the holiday has since been celebrated annually on June 19 in various parts of the United States, often broadly celebrating African-American culture. During the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s, these celebrations were eclipsed by the nonviolent determination to achieve civil rights, but grew in popularity again in the 1970s with a focus on African American freedom and African-American arts. With its adoption in certain parts of Mexico, the holiday became an international holiday. Juneteenth is celebrated by the Mascogos, descendants of Black Seminoles who escaped from slavery in 1852 and settled in Coahuila, Mexico. The holiday is considered the "longest-running African-American holiday" and has been called "America's second Independence Day". African Americans were often prohibited from using public facilities for their celebrations, so they were often held at churches or near water. Celebrations are commonly accompanied by voter registration efforts, the performing of plays, and retelling stories.  The Great Depression forced many black people off farms and into the cities to find work, where they had difficulty taking the day off to celebrate. From 1936 to 1951, the Texas State Fair served as a destination for celebrating the holiday, contributing to its revival. Juneteenth soon saw a revival as black people began tying their struggle to that of ending slavery. In Atlanta, some campaigners for equality wore Juneteenth buttons.
The Texas Legislature passed a bill in 1979 and was officially made a state holiday on January 1, 1980. Before 2000, three more U.S. states officially observed the day, and over the next two decades it was recognized as an official observance in all states, except South Dakota, until becoming a federal holiday. In June 2019, Governor of Pennsylvania Tom Wolf recognized Juneteenth as a holiday in the state. In 2020, state governors of Virginia, New York, and New Jersey signed an executive order recognizing Juneteenth as a paid day of leave for state employees. In 2021, Governor of Oregon Kate Brown, signed an executive order recognizing Juneteenth as a paid day of leave for state employees. On June 16, 2021, Illinois Governor J. B. Pritzker signed House Bill 3922, establishing Juneteenth as a paid state holiday starting in 2022; since 2003, it had been a state ceremonial observance in Illinois. In 1997, activist Ben Haith created the Juneteenth flag, which was further refined by illustrator Lisa Jeanne Graf. In 2000, the flag was first hoisted at the Roxbury Heritage State Park in Boston by Haith. The star at the center represents Texas and the extension of freedom for all African Americans throughout the whole nation.  On June 21, 2014, the Galveston Historical Foundation and Texas Historical Commission erected a Juneteenth plaque where the Osterman Building once stood signifying the location of Major General Granger's Union Headquarters. The red, white, and blue colors represent the American flag, which shows that African Americans and their enslaved ancestors are Americans, and the national believe in liberty and justice for all citizens. The holiday has gained mainstream awareness outside African-American communities through depictions in entertainment media, such as episodes of TV series Atlanta (2016) and  Black-ish (2017), the latter of which featured musical numbers about the holiday by Aloe Blacc, The Roots, and Fonzworth Bentley. In 2018, Apple added Juneteenth to its calendars in iOS under official U.S. holidays. In 1996, the first federal legislation to recognize "Juneteenth Independence Day" was introduced in the U.S. House of Representative.  In 1997, Congress recognized the day through Senate Joint Resolution 11 and House Joint Resolution 56.  In the 2000s and 2010s, activists continued a long process to push Congress towards official recognition of Juneteenth.When it was officially made a federal holiday on June 17, 2021, it became one of five date-specific federal holidays. In 2020, several American corporations and educational institutions, including Twitter, the National Football League, Nike, announced that they would treat Juneteenth as a company holiday, providing a paid day off to their workers, And  Google Calendar added Juneteenth to its U.S. Holidays calendar. In 2020, controversy ensued when President Donald Trump initially scheduled a presidential campaign rally– for June 19 in Tulsa, Oklahoma, the site of the 1921 race massacre in the Greenwood district. Boston's unanimous resolution apologized for the city's role in the trans-Atlantic slave trade. The resolution acknowledged and apologized for the ongoing impact of the slave trade on the Black community centuries later. For decades, activists and congress members (led by many African Americans) proposed legislation, advocated for, and built support for state and national observances. During his campaign for president in June 2020, Joe Biden publicly celebrated the holiday. President Donald Trump, during his campaign for reelection, added making the day a national holiday part of his "Platinum Plan for Black America".

 <h1> Second Amendment</h1>
<p>  The Second Amendment was based partially on the right to keep and bear arms in English common law and was influenced by the English Bill of Rights of 1689. the right is not unlimited and does not preclude the existence of certain long-standing prohibitions such as those forbidding "the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill" or restrictions on "the carrying of dangerous and unusual weapons". This raises the question of whether we still need to protect our selves now that we govern ourselves and have laws. The need for self-defense continues and we have seen an increase in mass and school shootings. Are the guns in the hands of mentally ill keeping us safe? The bald eagle is a sacred bird in some North American cultures. Eagles are considered spiritual messengers between gods and humans by some cultures. The founders of the United States were fond of comparing their new republic with the Roman Republic, in which eagle imagery was prominent. On June 20, 1782, the Continental Congress adopted the design for the Great Seal of the United States, depicting a bald eagle grasping 13 arrows and an olive branch with thirteen leaves with its talons. The bald eagle appears on most official seals of the U.S. government, including the presidential seal, the presidential flag, and in the logos of many U.S. federal agencies. In a letter written to his daughter in 1784 Benjamin Franklin stated his personal distaste for the bald eagle's behavior.” I wish the bald eagle had not been chosen the representative of our country. He is a bird of bad moral character. He does not get his living honestly ... besides he is a rank coward: The little king bird not bigger than a sparrow attacks him boldly and drives him out of the district”. The call of the red-tailed hawk, which is much louder and more powerful, is often substituted for bald eagles
