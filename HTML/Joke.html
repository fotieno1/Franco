     <h2>  The big joke</h2>  
        <p>There is an attempt to blackmail the government of the USA by withholding essential services. The COVID-19 has created a unique situation. The recent mass resignation is creating an opportunity to reorganize American laborers. People are willing to try new jobs while the economy is recovering. It is therefore not hard to find people willing to provide essential services for their community. This may be a blessing in disguise because it will put the provision of essential services in the hands of the people. From CEOs to our children, we have a generation that feel entitled.. The video showing the murder of George Floyd shows the attitude in law enforcement. The attitude of the rich and privileged makes them  think they own the country.. The rhetoric in our campaign advertisements reveal that there are some Americans  that still believe in white supremacy and the civil war mentality. Even the advertising insult the intelligence of Americans. One fundamental question we have to collectively answer is what do we need policing for. There is no need to send a militarized force to do social work or to solve  mental crisis. We are free to choose until we choose abortion and cannot choose common sense gun reforms that we agree are needed. The chants at Charleston show that there are people who see America as belonging to them. The voter suppression has created an opportunity for the voices of immigrants who some see as criminals rapists and drug addicts to be heard. From the Chinese exclusion to Japanese isolation camps to recent Asian hate these immigrants have not had a say on how this country is led. Many of these people have developed this country to what it is, yet  their efforts are not being recognized leaving the dreamers with nobody to speak for them. It is difficult for the people of color to see white poor people as victims because the rich have been using them to enact racist policies which have disproportionately favored them. In reality, they are also victims and are only now  experiencing what people of color have been experiencing all along. The call to make America great again and return to regular order is an acknowledgment that the country is headed in the wrong direction. The people who enacted and enforced racist policies are long dead. Therefore, it is us continuing racism. If we did what some want on gun reforms and legislation, the country would be ungovernable. One wonders if a country that is ruled by less than 50% of its population, suppresses voting and has openly practiced racism even including it in its laws is democratic. Wouldn’t it be an opportunity for the government to explore a different way of policing. Those changing our laws to game the system, are  have had a head start because unfair college admission results in economic growth of equity. Hospitals are banding together into networks that control the price of healthcare and this is sending many to bankruptcy. In a nutshell they are becoming a monopoly. One popular line that is used by our lawmakers is that government should not come between you and the doctors. What they do not say is that the big pharmaceutical  companies are giving incentives to doctors to oversubscribe medications you don’t need. The big corporations are bankrolling the campaigns of the law makers through super packs. We cannot assume that the legislature is immune to the existence of moles within them. The fact is that current drug dealers are found in our hospitals. We could not enact common sense gun reforms and are unable to enact the build America better. To the rest of the world, we are a laughable country unable to invest in our infrastructure or children. Any venture capitalist knows that you cannot make money without investments. Instead of citizens picking  their leaders the leaders are picking their voters using gerrymandering of electoral districts. The endorsements are meaningless because leaders can not recall the endorsements. There is a a competition among conservatives for the previous president who was voted out by Americans after one term. While the USA supreme court has left the issue to political parties and states. The issue is violating the tenets of one person one vote. The results are people losing confidence in voting and don’t vote at all. This is allowing lawmakers to enact unpopular laws and deny the citizens justice they have taken for granted. Like animals to a slaughter house, we are being led to bankruptcy through medical bills, credit card debt, mortgages, student loans and high interest. Our leaders are beholden to big pharmaceutical and consider corporations as people. These corporations have made all of us vulnerable to supply chain problems because the products we rely on even medical is manufactured outside the country . We are therefore forced to ask. Is it cheaper to subsidize corporations who ship American jobs abroad so they can make more money and pay no taxes? While keeping their money in offshore accounts. The environment is not safe either. Those interested in making money whether we use polluted water or investing in fossil fuels responsible for changes in the climate. The obsession with fossil fuels exploration confirms that we don’t care about the environment and putting our children at risk because we are trying to make money.  While our leaders abuse the checks and balance in our constitution to frustrate the opposition even for things we need such as investment in our children and infrastructure. It makes no sense to elect leaders because their legislation no matter how good it is for the country will face an opposition determined to frustrate them using checks and balances in the constitution such as the filibuster. It is a waste of time seeking justice from leaders who have rigged themselves in through gerrymandering. Juries must take sides because the laws they are using leave them no choice but to find criminals not guilty even if we forget about their selection. Let us not elect tough leaders who have no clue what is good for our country but leaders who are fair regardless of their skin color. There wouldn’t be a moon landing and there will be no landing on mass as long as we doubt science. Follow the party line and act like an animal in the air but you will die alone. When others want to bring Americans down it is your responsibility to show how high America can go. The lessons of the Montgomery bus boycott , the march on Washington , the civil rights and the civil war have been forgotten. Our leaders don’t realize that their power and money come from the people. We cannot do the same things every two and four years and expect different results. It is insanity. Fellow Americans it is time to hit the reset button for America.
