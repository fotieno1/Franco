We Americans have to face the reality that raciism did not end with the civil war and continues to domniate white psyche.The shortcomings of the proposed gun reforms are discussed. The approach of our leaders in controlling immigration, crime and drugs is discussed. While the use of synthetic drugs is increasing some of our leaders want to focus on abortion. Some of our leaders claim they are pro-life but pay for abortion. Some suggestions are presented following an objective analysis of the USA. Short of cleaning the house thereâ€™s no way to clear up the infiltration of our government. Americans are cautioned against believing everything but verify whatever they are told. It is shown that it will be cost benefit for the USA to encourage people to press for democracy in place themselves.
