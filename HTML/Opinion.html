  <h1>Belief</h1>   
  <p>  People are responsible for their own destiny. It is unfair to deny anyone the opportunity to learn from their mistakes. The military has its place. Misusing military power makes the world violent. An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind. People resort to violence to resolve disputes because our ancestors used it as a primordial survival method. Everyone must do his part for all of us to succeed. Millions of fish die every year because they expect free meat. If they stopped to think they would realize that meat doesn’t grow in water. Therefore,  a floating piece is suspicious. Women and girls will lead the next liberation of Africa.  If you do anything for anyone, they don’t develop the ability to do it themselves. The longer  you do it the risk you will do it forever ; It is the way nature works. This is particularly true of parents who want to give their children everything they never heard growing up. Aging is a natural process that can only be slowed or hidden by human made products or methods. These include hair dye, wigs , clothing which make one appear younger and plastic surgery. Anything can be used for hypocrisy even prayer. Human beings are all equal no matter their color. The notion that we can develop deterrence capabilities and stop others from developing their own deterrent is delusional and bound to attract enemies abroad for us. It ushered the  Cold War and will lead to the proliferation of intercontinental ballistic missiles. The worst scenario is that of an extremist (domestic or foreign) who has been misinformed and acquires an Intercontinental ballistic missile. The proliferation of nuclear arms involved a few countries but the proliferation of intercontinental ballistic missiles will involve many countries and asymmetrical warfare. It is a misnomer that we can misuse our powerful military to impose our will on other countries. If there is a lesson the colonialists and Nazis learned is that one cannot fight with the whole world. Events in Afghanistan have shown that some problems don’t have a military solution. We can cheat ourselves that others hate our way of life but this is inconsistent with the many migrants flocking our borders in search of a better life. The entire world is still colonized. This time economically and millitaryly. We are enforcing slavery by our self for the oppresors. In short the entire world is colonized by proxy. Religion is being used to brain wash people into belivers.</p>
    
<h1>Confusing</h1>   
  <p>  Why children want to behave like adults while adults are struggling to look younger. Why light skinned folks are tanning their skin while those with dark skin are bleaching it.  People who depend on government programs and contracts are opposed to government intrusion. Why humans sheepishly follow mentally sick religious and political leaders even to their do. </p>
    
<h1>  Observations </h1>
   <p> Human beings follow Lenz’s law which govern the direction of electrical current when a coil is moving in a magnetic field. The current always flows in a direction that opposes the magnetic motions creating it. People always behave differently from your expectations. People only do things that matter to them and not you. As I visited a number of places it was obvious that these communities have never seen a black person let alone an immigrant. The difficult working conditions that have been created for immigrants have resulted in impossible conditions for natives and employers. The conditions are having unintended consequences for businesses that cannot do without immigrants. It is the African American who are pitted with migrants from Africa in employment. The African American view their brothers as not black enough because they lack a history of slavery. They view their brothers as threat to their jobs because the immigrants are able to work under the harsh conditions. Most people forget that immigrants have the American dream not just for themselves but also for their relatives and native countries. This needs to be considered to control immigration. Some people believe that a black person is not smart enough to hold a PhD. Ironically some in the immigrant community also hold low opinion of themselves and are satisfied with positions that they are overqualified for. Little do they realize that there is racism in employment and they are up against impossible odds and the interviews are only being used to racially profile the applicants. They have no chance of getting the job. To many there is no difference between the Africans and African-Americans until they talk and the accents are revealed. The rich people are frustrating both the poor white people, African Americans and the immigrants. They are victims of the same system. Therefore, directing anger and frustration at them  is  misguided.  It sows division. The grievances of those who invaded the capital remains unaddressed because of how they showed their frustrations but the anger remains a national security threat and should not be dealt with as a law enforcement issue only. The anger is a recruiting tool for white extremists and shows how white criminals are treated differently by the justice system. The extremists get their information from one source and are vulnerable to misinformation which has hindered efforts to control the pandemic. Denying the vaccine  the USA helped to develop, while the rest of the world waits makes us a laughable country. The country has always been ruled with less than half the population and they are alarmed by the changes taking place in the country. One of the strategies they are using is to make it harder to vote and rigging themselves into government and changing the laws in their favor while telling the poor white peoples whatever they want to hear. It is high time the poor white people realized that they are lumped together with African Americans, other minorities and immigrants. Some have already realized and are joining African Americans in the quest for justice demonstrations. People of color treat all white people as one and don’t understand the plight of the poor white people who have benefited from the racist policies framed as justice. </p>
    
<h1>  Patriotism</h1> 
 <p>   Americans will have to ask themselves which is more patriotic. Being a sycophant or pointing to the mistakes of the country. Immigrants know the dangers of sycophants in their former countries and how the countries have been destroyed. If the poor white peoples, African Americans, minorities and immigrants want their voices to be heard it will be more patriotic for them to vote. It will be easier to teach Asian Americans to vote than teach them martial arts to combat Asian hate. It is not enough to complain that Washington is not working if you don’t vote. Your leaders rigged in are busy changing the laws you need for justice. Is it patriotic to abuse the checks and balances in the constitution to frustrate the government to get your way while millions of Americans suffer? Americans need to ask who is American. Do you have to be rich and White? Is it patriotic to hold your money in offshore accounts to avoid paying for what is due to the government and expect it to provide the services you need?  They say follow the money. Where one keeps their money shows where their hearts are. It is not with USA. The African American needs to ask themselves who are their brothers is it based on skin color(the very definition of racism) or suffering. They should realize that some of the whites  also  pushed  for abolition of slavery and fought during the civil war. The fact is that I as a black man would not have proved myself were it not for a White man. Let us work together to make this a better country for all. No one race can do it alone. Is it patriotic to sabotage the government program you are working for? Sabotaging the government and gumming operations from inside by using its rules in place to reduce fraud and filibuster. One thing that is being ignored is that the poor white peoples are as much victims of the haves. For a long time, they have been used and so feel entitled  while the African Americans view them as beneficiaries of the racist policies. </p>
    
<h1>  Thoughts</h1>
   <p> The human body is not designed to live forever. You can only delay the aging process by diet and exercises. Even cloned cells retain age information. We have created a billion dollar industry to compete with a natural process. You cannot defund the Police without affecting the security. You cannot starve the beast you depend on. By keeping quiet, immigrants are not pointing out injustices and are taxed but not heard: The very reason for the Boston tea party uprising. Unrepresentative leaders are rigged in by unfair practices such as gerrymandering. They enact unpopular laws and they are accountable for nobody. Freedom is an illusion.  We live by many laws. Not following the laws of nature results in death. Not following government rules fair or unfair put you in prison. Not abiding by community norms earn you society condemnations. If your property falls in eminent domain it can be taken for public good. The books you check out, what you search on the internet, your friends, online conversations, phone calls and  your financial transaction can be traced. Cameras can watch your every move. They can all be used for national security matters. Even what you like is used to target you for marketing. The advertisements hide the catches in the fine print. Even what you like can be used by scammers in a bait and switch scheme. The USA will have to come to the understanding that the majority is not always right and veto power is not consistent with democracy especially when leaders are rigged in by gerrymandering. Until the poor people (white or black) are able to make their voices heard the rich people will tell them whatever they want to hear and do whatever they want once elected. The immigrant and the minority voices can only be heard through fair elections in a democracy. The founders of this country provided a way for these voices to be heard in fair elections. One way to stand up to these political bullies is to vote before they change the laws in this country to keep them in power indefinitely. Keep in mind that those gaming the system have had a head start and therefore have the means to tilt the field in their favor. This includes economic and legal means. Immigrants must not forget the slave mentality which some are championing and the freedoms in this country they take for granted and some are trying to take away.  Even companies have to stand up against economic blackmail used to force them  to embrace views they don’t agree with. It makes no sense for me that we can communicate with the space station and work remotely using wireless internet yet we continue to put law enforcement officials and the American public in danger by conducting high speed chases of errant vehicles relying on computers to operate. The manufacturers can build a kill switch enabling law enforcement officials to stop a vehicle remotely without high speed chases.

<h1> The mafia and our government </h1>
<p> Giuliani led the 1980s federal prosecution of New York City mafia. In 2014, it was revealed that a Sicilian Mafia leader, had ordered a murder contract on Giuliani during the mid 1980s. Giuliani joined President Donald Trump's personal legal team in April 2018.  He was a central figure in the Trump–Ukraine scandal, which resulted in Trump's first impeachment. Following the 2020 presidential election, he represented Trump in many lawsuits filed in attempts to overturn the election results, making false and debunked allegations about rigged voting machines, polling place fraud, and an international communist conspiracy. Thus the methods of the mafia and the working of our government is known to the mafia. We have seen attempts to operate our government like a cartel or crime family. The resulting cowboy diplomacy has made the world a dangerous place for Americans. We Americans like to separate actions of autocratic governments from the people of the country. Yet some of our leaders openly advocate torture and assassinations even providing cover for assassins. The stuffing of the judiciary with loyalists is an attempt to corrupt the judicial system, particularly the supreme court. These are the very tools for the mafia. The careless handling of intelligence forced the government of the USA to do a damage assessment. Allies of the USA can expect the information to be used to extort them. This is making our teaching morality to the world suspect. It makes the work of our government harder and provides a road map for autocratic administrations around the world.</p>
